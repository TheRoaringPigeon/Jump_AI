Genetic "learning" with jumping dots and platforms

Each jumper is spawned with a set of random instructions. 
The jumper gets a score based on how many checkpoints it obtains as it jumps on platforms. 
The better scoring jumpers are more likely to "reproduce" and thus each generation is a bit better.
